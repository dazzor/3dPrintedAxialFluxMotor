3d Printed Axial Flux Motor Build
This information is very basic. Detailed decriptions of how brushless DC motors work are available on the web and YouTube. I learned to build the motors I build from DIYProjects.com where anyone can buy his manual. The motors I build are significantly different in design. I give different details and 3d printed parts I designed using OpenSCAD and printed on an Ender 3 printer using PLA filiment.
